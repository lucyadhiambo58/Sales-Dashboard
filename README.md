The purpose of the project was to analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for 
business decision-making.

In this project, I dived into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling products, calculate revenue 
metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and created visualizations to present my 
findings effectively. 
The project showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights 
from large datasets, enabling me to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing 
sales strategies
